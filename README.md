# Description
This week, we were tasked to create an application called `ZooKeeper`. This Express application will be successful when we complete the following `tasks`:

- Configure an Express.js back end to serve static HTML files.

- Configure an Express.js back end to create an API to handle GET and POST requests.

- Parse parameters in server-side routes.

- Submit form data to a server.

- Implement separation of concerns for routing.

- Deploy a server-side application to the Heroku platform.


# Install
You can either choose to clone the repositiory and save it on your device, or you can access the deployed site using the link in the Deployed Site section of this ReadMe.

# Purpose
`Here's the scenario: the local zoo has received funding to build a new online catalog, and they've asked you to create a web server for a front-end application they’re developing, called Zoo Keepr. This site’s data will be stored on the server you create. This will allow animal enthusiasts to access the data from different locations and browsers without needing to download it to their device`.
